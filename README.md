# All Countries and Cities JSON

This JSON file was built after searching for an appropriately structured JSON collection and not finding one.

What I needed for myself was a file that was structured in the following format:

```
{
  "country": "Albania",
  "city": [
    "Elbasan",
    "Petran",
    "Pogradec",
    "Shkoder",
    "Tirana",
    "Ura Vajgurore"     
  ]
}

```

The file contains all world countries with their top towns and cities attached arranged in alphabetical order.

Be sure to **view raw**!

### Appreciation

Major credit goes to the [GeoNames Website](http://www.geonames.org/) as well as @github/meMo-Minsk and @github/samayo for their own repositories that got me started on this path, and last but not least [Alphabetizer](https://alphabetizer.flap.tv/) 
(Note to self, build a similar tool someday)
